# Project Proposal

## A streamlined hotel management application using AI to create Synergy between various hotel employees 


## HCK

## This software is intended to facilitate guest experience at the HCK hotel from the time they check-in until check-out, as well as coordination of employee tasks and management solutions. In other words, it is an all-in-one solution for employees, hotel management, and customers.

## This app will have a different graphical user interface based on the role of the user. Based on what is planned, there will be different types of users (actors) for hotel customers, employees, and management. This is because the roles will be using the app for different purposes. 

## Customers can book rooms, open help desk tickets, send messages to room service. Employees can receive messages based on their role. Room service and luggage carriers receive messages from customers and can locate their rooms. Janitors and maintenance workers receive tasks from management. Managers have access to chat logs, and they handle customer complaints. In addition, they give tasks to the employees (ex. A spill is reported to a manager in the app, and a manager sends a task to a janitor.) They also have access to hotel data (like how booked the hotel is) in order to decide how many people need to come in on that day.
